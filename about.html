                        <li>Ban Vs Pump</li>
                        
                        <p>In the first movie for the show the seven deadly sins<br>
                        have to fight off demons from a sky world that have been <br>
                        locked away for thousands of years. These demons emerge <br>
                        wanting blood but ban the undead can care less about they're wants<br>
                        he goes straight in on them and gets put down my one of the<br>
                        demons and is "killed" but of course he comes back alive<br>
                        adn then get beat up so bad he had no choice to but to retreat. </p>
                        
                        <li>Ban Vs Galand</li>
                        
                        <p>Ban the fox sin of Greed is not a force to
                        be reckoned with,<br> he is sneaky and has tricks up his
                        sleeves for days. But Galand the commandment of Truth
                        of the Ten Commandments is a brute force type of person 
                        so you would think but Ban being undead you would think 
                        Gakand had no chance?<br> Incorrect, ban got DESTROYED by Galand
                        and had to retreat where he would run into another one of
                        the Sins who happily helped.</p>
                        
                        <li>Ban Vs King</li>
                        
                        <p>Ban the "undead" is not an understatement,<br> he cannot die
                        unless his soul is stolen or eaten other than that he's pretty much invulnerable
                        to anything.<br> But he can still be damaged badly, as shown by 
                        the fairy king himself (as his name implies) King.</p>
